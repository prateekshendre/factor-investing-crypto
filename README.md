# 🤖 Machine Learning for Financial Risk

End-to-end **credit default and counterparty risk modeling pipeline** with explainability and governance.  
This repo contains a reproducible pipeline from ingestion through explainability and a minimal deployment path.

---

## 🚀 What this project does

* Ingest raw loan or counterparty level data and produce cleaned feature sets  
* Encode and scale variables using reproducible preprocessing pipelines  
* Train logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting candidate models  
* Validate performance with time-based splits and cross-validation  
* Explain model behavior with SHAP for global and local interpretability  
* Produce model cards and validation reports for governance

---

## 📂 Data

* Sample development datasets live in `data/examples/`  
* Production data should be ingested via `src/ingestion.py` and stored securely in `data/feature_store/` or object storage  
* Keep cleaned CSV or parquet snapshots under `data/` for reproducibility

---

## 🛠 Methods & tools

* pandas, numpy for data pipelines  
* scikit-learn for preprocessing and baseline models  
* xgboost or lightgbm for boosted trees  
* shap for explainability  
* mlflow for experiment tracking (optional)  
* pytest for unit tests  
* Docker for packaging
